.SYNOPSIS
This function will allow admin to move files using an input file based on CSV.  It expects to pull from a file that has this type of content:

\\servername\c$\folder\username\folder\file.extension
\\servername\c$\folder\username\folder\file.extension

It will split at the username portion so we can capture the username in the statement.  This can be modified according to the directories you're dealing with.

.DESCRIPTION
This script is really meant to be used in conjuction with a script to find the file owner by UNC path.  Such a script would print the filenames in a CSV file for input.
In addition, such a script will have folders prefixed with folders that have the username in the path.  It is for a specific case, like home folders.

.PARAMETER inputfile
This is the full path of the CSV file.

.PARAMETER username
This will name the folder according to the username you enter.

.PARAMETER destinationpath
This is the UNC pathname of the destination you want to use.

.EXAMPLE
Move-UserFiles -inputfule C:\Temp\Test.csv -Username jdoe -DestinationPath \\FileServer\share\subfolder.

.NOTES
All Parameters are required.
